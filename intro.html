    "Hi, my name is John. I enjoy spending my free time playing sports, especially basketball and tennis. I also like to read and learn new things. In particular, I enjoy playing chess, which helps me with strategic thinking."
Tips for choosing hobbies to mention:
Be honest: Share hobbies you genuinely enjoy.
Be relevant: If you're introducing yourself in a professional setting, choose hobbies that subtly highlight relevant skills or personality traits (e.g., if applying for a creative role, mention painting or writing).
Keep it concise: Don't overshare. A few hobbies are enough.
Be positive: Frame your hobbies in a way that highlights their positive aspects
